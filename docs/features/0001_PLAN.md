# Feature Plan: Phase 1 - Basic Web Application with Job Listing

## Context

Phase 1 establishes the foundation of the AI Interviewer Platform by creating a working Streamlit web application that displays a list of jobs and enables navigation to interview rooms. This phase focuses on the frontend structure, job data model, and basic routing using Streamlit's session state.

## Files to Create

### `main.py` (modify existing)
- Replace current placeholder code with Streamlit application entry point
- Implement main application flow with page routing logic
- Use Streamlit session state to track current page (`current_page`) and selected job (`selected_job_id`)
- Render job listing page by default
- Handle navigation to interview room page when job is selected
- Include all page rendering functions in single file (job listing and interview room)

### `data/jobs.json` (new)
- JSON file containing array of at least 3 sample job objects
- Each job object contains fields:
  - `id`: str (unique identifier)
  - `title`: str (job title)
  - `description`: str (short job description)
  - `department`: str (department name)
  - `location`: str (job location)
  - `requirements`: array of str (list of job requirements)
- Sample jobs should represent diverse roles (e.g., Software Engineer, Product Manager, Data Scientist)

### `models/job.py` (new)
- Define `Job` data class or TypedDict with fields matching JSON schema:
  - `id`: str
  - `title`: str
  - `description`: str
  - `department`: str
  - `location`: str
  - `requirements`: list[str]
- Create function `load_jobs()` that reads `data/jobs.json` and returns list of `Job` instances
- Handle JSON parsing and validation

### Job Listing Page (in `main.py`)
- Create `render_job_listing()` function
- Display list of jobs using Streamlit components (e.g., `st.columns`, `st.button`, or `st.selectbox`)
- For each job, show title, description, department, location, and requirements
- When user clicks/selects a job, set `selected_job_id` in session state and change `current_page` to "interview_room"

### Interview Room Page (in `main.py`)
- Create `render_interview_room()` function with basic layout structure
- Display selected job information (title, description, department, location)
- Create placeholder UI sections for:
  - Question display area
  - Answer input area
  - Conversation history panel
  - End interview button (non-functional placeholder)
- Include "Back" button that resets `current_page` to "job_listing" and clears `selected_job_id`
- Layout should establish visual structure for Phase 2 implementation

## Algorithms and Logic

### Page Routing Algorithm
1. Initialize session state if not present:
   - `current_page`: defaults to "job_listing"
   - `selected_job_id`: defaults to `None`
2. In main application loop:
   - If `current_page == "job_listing"`: call `render_job_listing()`
   - If `current_page == "interview_room"`: call `render_interview_room()`
3. Navigation flow:
   - Job selection sets `selected_job_id` and `current_page = "interview_room"`
   - Back button sets `current_page = "job_listing"` and `selected_job_id = None`

### Job Selection Logic
1. User interacts with job display (click button, select from dropdown, etc.)
2. Extract job `id` from user interaction
3. Store `id` in `st.session_state.selected_job_id`
4. Set `st.session_state.current_page = "interview_room"`
5. Streamlit re-runs and renders interview room page

## Implementation Notes

- Use Streamlit's `st.session_state` for state management (no external state management needed)
- Job data is stored in `data/jobs.json` and loaded via `load_jobs()` function
- Interview room page includes basic layout structure with placeholder sections for future functionality
- Ensure job IDs are unique strings (e.g., "job_1", "job_2", "job_3")
- Job descriptions should be concise but informative (2-3 sentences each)
- All page rendering functions are in single `main.py` file (no separate page modules)
- Interview room layout should use Streamlit layout components (`st.columns`, `st.container`) to establish visual structure
